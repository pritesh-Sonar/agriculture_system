  IntroDescription: "Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the most important food crop of the world. Potato is a temperate crop grown under subtropical conditions in India. The potato is a crop which has always been the ‘poor man’s friend’. Potato is <br>being cultivated in the country for the last more than 300 years. For vegetable purposes it has become one of the most popular crops in this country. Potatoes are an economical food; they provide a source of low cost energy to<br> the human diet. Potatoes are a rich source of starch, vitamins especially C and B1 and minerals. They contain 20.6 per cent carbohydrates, 2.1 per cent protein, 0.3 per cent fat, 1.1 per cent crude fibre and 0.9 per cent ash.<br> They also contain a good amount of essential amino acids like leucine, tryptophane and isoleucine etc. Potatoes are used for several industrial purposes such as for the production of starch and alcohol.<br> Potato starch (farina) is used in laundries and for sizing yarn in textile mills. Potatoes are also used for the production of dextrin and glucose. As a food product itself, potatoes are converted into dried products such as ‘potato chips’, ‘sliced’ or ‘shredded <br>potatoes’. It is a much branched bushy herb, usually 0.5 to 1m in height possesing underground stems bearing the edible tubers. The leaves are odd pinate with a large terminal leaflet. It flowers in cymose panicles.<br> Potato is grown almost in all states of India. However, the major potato rowing states are Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar and Assam.",

      Description4: "Bacterial wilt is spread mainly through cucumber beetles (striped and spotted). The cucumber beetle is a small insect—yellow in color with either black stripes or spots on its back.<br> It picks up the bacteria while feeding on infected cucumbers and transfers them to other plants in the same manner. The bacteria survive winters by living in their beetles' guts.",

Climate: "Carrots thrive in temperate climatic conditions. They require cool temperatures for optimal growth, preferably between 15°C and 20°C. However, they can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 25°C.<br> Carrots require well-drained soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.0. They prefer loose, sandy loam soil that is rich in organic matter.",
Soil: "Before sowing carrot seeds, it is essential to prepare the soil properly. Begin by removing any weeds and debris from the field. Carrots require loose soil with good drainage.<br> Therefore, the soil should be tilled and broken down to a fine tilth. Adding organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, can improve soil fertility and structure.",

IntroDescription: "Carrot cultivation has a long history in India and is an integral part of the agricultural landscape. Carrots are rich in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, making them a nutritious addition to any diet.<br> Additionally, they are used in various culinary preparations, including salads, soups, and juices. The demand for carrots in the market is high, both domestically and internationally, making it a lucrative crop for farmers.",

    Description1: " The disease produce severe blighting on carrot leaves and petioles if wet weather is prolonged during the growing season. Entire leaves and petioles may die on severely infected plants.<br> The symptoms first appear along the margins of the leaves, often causing the leaves to curl. Spots inside the leaf edges are small, roughly circular, and tan or gray to brown with a dead center.<br> As the lesions increase in number and size, the entire leaflet withers and dies. The fungus attacks younger leaves and plants in preference to older ones. In heavily infested fields, however, both lder and younger leaves are subject to attack. <br>The pathogen also produces lesions on the petioles and stems. The lesions may merge and girdle the stems, causing the leaves to die. Control: The leaf blight pathogens can survive from one year to the next in infected plant debris.<br> Therefore, a two-to three-year rotation is recommended to allow for natural decline in the pathogen population. The use of disease-free seed is strongly recommended because the fungus can survive on or in the seed. <br>Early applications of Foltaf (0.2%), Copper Oxychloride (0.3%), starting at the first sign of infection, effectively control leaf blights on carrots.<br> Best control is achieved when fungicides are applied at high pressure and in sufficient water to reach the lower leaves in a dense canopy",

    Description2: "Alternaria leaf spots first appear at the margin of the leaflets and are dark brown to black and irregular in shape. Lesions produced on the petioles and stems are dark brown and often coalesce and girdle the <br>tems. As the disease progresses entire leaflets may shrivel and die, appearing scorched. Alternaria leaf lesions are generally more prevalent on older foliage and plants than on young foliage. The disease spreads rapidly on the older <br>leaves of a maturing crop after the rows have closed. This is due in part to poor air circulation among the older lower leaves in the canopy and to the moisture-holding capacity of the dense foliage. <br>Control:<br> The disease can be kept under check if a well-drained soil is selected and suitable crop rotation is adopted.  Since the fungus can survive in the seed, hot water treatment at 50°C for 15 minutes is recommended.<br> Seed treatment with Thiram (3g/kg of seed) before sowing is effective to control the disease. Crop rotation and destruction of infected plant material in the field will minimize the disease infection, <br>Fungicidal applications with Foltaf (0.2%), Copper Oxychloride (0.3%) satisfactorily controls the disease.",

    Description4:"Carrots are susceptible to this disease, especially late in the season and during storage. The disease is present in soil or storage areas and often shows up after the crop has been harvested.<br> Symptoms can be dentified in the field as characteristic white mold with black sclerotia present on the crown of infected carrots. In storage, a soft, watery rot with white mold and black sclerotia characterizes the disease.<br> Control: Crop rotation, weed control (to improve air circulation), planting on raised beds, winter flooding, rapid cooling prior to storage and meticulous sanitation of all storage components are all necessary to reduce losses from this disease.",
