        Description: "CEAXOR can be used for organic production and targets common fungal diseases such as Botrytis, Powdery Mildew, Anthracnose, Didymella bryoniae (Gummy Stem Blight) and several leaf spot diseases such as Alternaria and Entomosporium. CEAXOR also controls bacterial diseases such as Pseudomonas, Erwinia, and Xanthomonas spp., as well as the soil diseases Rhizoctonia, Pythium, Fusarium and Phytophthora.<br>CEAXOR is a contact fungal repellent containing a strain of the Bacillus which works in two ways. First, the bacterial spores occupy space on the plant surface and compete with the pathogens; then active compounds called lipopeptides produced by each bacterium disrupt the germination and growth of invading pathogens. Due to this action, resistance is not likely to develop.<br> CEAXOR can be used in combination with and/or in rotation with other products and as part of an effective resistance management program.",
